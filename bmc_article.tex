\section*{Background}
 * We have made progress towards eradication because of co-ordinated interventions
 * We still have a way to go in areas like ...
 * We have made progress in exploring detailed intervention strategies \cite{griffin_reducing_2010,griffin_estimates_2014,sherrard-smith_systematic_2018,okell_contrasting_2014}
 * Mathematical based models can improve our planning. Eradication, stochasticity, complexity, flexibility.

\section*{Methods}

We used individual to structure our model. Individual variables and events.

\subsection*{Vector biology}

We modelled the dominant Malaria vectors for P. Falciparum. Their feeding cycle affects their susceptibility to vector controls and infectiousness to humans.

The vector model was split between the aquatic and adult-female stage

\subsubsection*{Aquatic stage}

This stage tracks compartments of mosquitoes in larval and pupal states. The emergence of adult mosquitoes is dictated by this model.

The ODEs model the dynamics of ovoposition and mortality of these states.

Carrying capacity drives the mortality of early and late stage mosquitoes.

%TODO: carrying capacity equation

Rainfall is modeled from Fourier analyses of average rainfall

%TODO: rainfall equation

\begin{gather*}
    \frac{dE^v}{dt} = \beta_{egg}^v(t) M - \frac{E^v}{de} - \mu_e E^v \left(1 + \frac{E^v + L^v}{K}\right) \\
    \frac{dL^v}{dt} = \frac{E^v}{de} - \frac{L^v}{dl} - \mu_l L^v \left(1 + \gamma \frac{E^v + L^v}{K}\right)  \\
    \frac{dP^v}{dt} = \frac{L^v}{dl} - \frac{P^v}{dp} - \mu_p P^v
\end{gather*}

% TODO: where are these parameters fit from?
% take from S3 refs 47 -53

\subsubsection*{Adult female mosquitoes}

We modeled adult female mosquitoes to track the infectious population, fecundity and mosquito mortality. Mosquitoes emerge susceptible, undergo an EIP and then become infected.

The adult population can be modeled either individually or with ODEs.

\begin{gather*}
    \frac{dS^v_m}{dt} = -\Lambda_M^v S_m + \beta_{em}^v(t) - \mu^v S^v_m \\
    \frac{dE^v_m}{dt} = \Lambda_M^v S^v_m + \beta_{em}^v(t) - \Lambda^v(t - \tau) S^v_m(t - \tau) \exp(-\mu^v\tau) - \mu^v E^v_m \\
    \frac{dI^v_m}{dt} = \Lambda_M^v(t - \tau) S^v_m(t - \tau) \exp(-\mu^v\tau) - \mu^v I^v_m
\end{gather*}

We created an individual-based alternative which uses bernoulli processes to model infection and death.

We use a $Mosquito_state$ variable to track the infection state of each mosquito. % TODO image

% TODO: where are these parameters fit from?
% take from S3 refs 47 -53

\subsection*{Human infection}

Human infection states are stored for each individual. We use bernoulli processes every timestep to transition individuals between infection these states.

%TODO: Graph of infection state transitions

\subsubsection*{Immunity}

Humans have several layers of protection against infection.

\subsubsection*{Pre-erythrocytic}

The first is blood immunity. %what is this%

\[
b_i(t) = b_0 \left( b_1 + \frac{1 - b_1}{1 + \frac{IB}{IB_0}^{kb}} \right)
\]

This is tracked by a double per human, $IB$. It is incremented each time a human is bitten. $IB$ also decays exponentially.

\subsubsection*{Clinical}

Then protection from clinical immunity %What is this%

\[
\phi_i(t) = \phi_0 \left( \phi_1 + \frac{1 - \phi_1}{1 + \frac{I_{CA}(i, t) + I_{CM}(i, t)}{I_{C0}}^{k_c}} \right)
\]

This is tracked by a double per human, $ICA$. It is incremented each time a human is bitten. $ICA$ also decays exponentially.

A variable $ICM$ is used to track maternal immunity to clinical infection. It is set on the birth of the individual. It also decays every time step.

\subsubsection*{Severe}

Then protection from severe immunity %what is this%

\[
\theta_i(t, a) = \theta_0 \left( \theta_1 + \frac{1 - \theta_1}{1 + f_v(i, a)\frac{I_{VA}(i, t) + I_{VM}(i, t)}{I_{V0}}^{k_v}} \right)
\]

where,

\[
f_v(i, a) = 1 - \frac{1 - f_{v0}}{1 + \frac{a}{a_v}^{\gamma_v}}
\]

This is tracked by a double per human, $IVA$. It is incremented each time a human is bitten. $IVA$ also decays exponentially.

A variable $IVM$ is used to track maternal immunity to clinical infection. It is set on the birth of the individual. It also decays every time step.

\subsubsection*{Onward infectiousness}

Humans drive infection towards mosquitoes

\[
\Lambda^v_M(t) = \alpha^v \sum_i c(i, t) \pi(i)
\]

The infectivity towards mosquitoes, $c$, is stored per individual. It is updated once an individual changes state.

\[
c(i, t) =
\begin{cases} 
  0  & state(i, t) \in \{S, T\} \\
  c_D & state(i, t) = D \\
  c_U & state(i, t) = U \\
  c_A(i, t) & state(i, t) = A
\end{cases}
\]

where,

\[  c_A(i, t) = c_U + (c_D - c_U) q_i \gamma^1 \]

\subsection*{Interventions}

These are some of the main interventions we model.

\subsubsection*{Vector controls}

Vector controls directly affect mosquito death rates, biting rates and force of infection towards mosquitoes.

% List death rate equation
The death rate is

\[
\mu^v = -f_R^v \log(p_1^vp_2^v)
\]

Where,

\begin{gather*}
p_1^v = \frac{p_{10}^vW^v}{1 - Z^vp^v_{10}} \\
p_{10}^v = \exp(-\mu_0^v\delta^v_{10}) \\
p_2^v = \exp(-\mu_0^v\delta^v_2) \\
f_R^v = \frac{1}{\delta^v_1 + \delta^v_2}
\end{gather*}

% List biting rate after vector controls
The biting rate is

\[
\alpha^v = Q^v f^v_R
\]

where,

\[
Q^v = 1 - \frac{1 - Q_0^v}{W^v}
\]

% List FOIM after vector controls
The effective biting rate for each human is

\[
\lambda^v_i = \frac{\alpha^v\pi_iy^v_i}{\sum_i \pi_i w^v_i}
\]

where,

\begin{gather*}
    W^v = 1 - Q_0^v + Q_0^v \sum_i \pi_iw_i^v\\
    Z^v = Q_0^v \sum_i \pi_iz_i^v
\end{gather*}

Vector controls lead to three possible outcomes. The probabilities of these outcomes are modelled as follows:

\begin{gather*}
    w_i = 1 - \Phi_I + \Phi_B(1 -  r_S)s_Ns_S + (\Phi_I - \Phi_B)(1 - r_S)s_S\\
    y_i = 1 - \Phi_I + \Phi_B(1 -  r_S)s_N + (\Phi_I - \Phi_B)(1 - r_S)\\
    z_i = \Phi_B(1 - r_S)r_N + \Phi_Ir_S
\end{gather*}

If IRS is disabled, $\Phi_I = r_S = 0, s_S = 1$. If LLINs are disabled $\Phi_B = r_N = 0, s_N = 1$.

\subsubsection*{Treatment}

Treatment diverts humans from clinical and severe infection.

It also provides prophylaxis which is modelled with a weibull curve.

% List equation for prophylaxis

% Table for prophylaxis params

\subsubsection*{Mass drug administration}

Mass drug administration can be used to induce prophylaxis in a large subset of the population.

MDA strategies can distribute a specific drug, at a list of timesteps, with specified coverages, over a specified age range.

\subsubsection*{Vaccination}

RTS,S vaccination can be used to reduce the probability of pre-erthrocytic infection.

% List equation for vaccine efficacy

RTS,S vaccines can be distributed in an EPI strategy %what is this

%How does this work

RTS,S vaccines can also be distributed in a mass campaign.

\subsubsection*{Correlation}

For interventions where a subset is selected. We correlate the sub populations between interventions with the following formulae
